# Collective Behaviour Project
A project for the course Collective Behaviour at the Faculty of Computer and Information Science in year 2024/25.

## Objective
The objective of this project is to recreate an existing collective behaviour model and expand on that research. The starting point is the article
*Flock response to sustained asynchronous predator attacks* written by Siddhant Mohapatra and Pallab Sinha Mahapatra. The article is avaiable at this [link](https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.11.14.567144).
The idea is first to recreate the model in this article, trying to get to the same conclusions. After this additional effects will be taken into consideration like maybe environmental complexity, multisensory inputs or additional more realistic modeling of the agents. Which additional effects will be explored will depend on additional research on this topic, new knowledge and ideas gained through lectures for this subject and on general personal interest. 

## Work plan
- By first report deadline (16.11.2024): Recreate the original model and write a report and making sure to get to the same conclusions.
- By second report deadline (7.12.2024): Extend the original model with some additional complexity and look how results change with respect to the original article.
- By final report deadline (11.1.2025): Improving the report based on the feedback.
